Hi!
This is an external cheat for Yu-Gi-Oh! The Sacred Cards (GBA) based on my own cheat framework **[osmium](https://github.com/cragson/osmium)**. 
The cheat and the framework are written in C++.

### Important Notes
- **This only works on mGBA emulator under Windows**
- **This uses my own mGBA Scripting API wrapper for C++, so please make sure to have a look into the [Setup-Guide](https://github.com/cragson/mgba-api/tree/master#setup) in the specific repository**
